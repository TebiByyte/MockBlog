                   Generative AI is one of the most influential inventions within the last couple of years. AI generated content is everywhere you look on the Internet, from art, to music, to even code, it is everywhere. But, with the invention of AI there are some massive ethical considerations that go ignored by the average user, and the companies that train the AI models themselves. Who owns the generated work? What is the generated work being used for? How is the work generated? These are just a few big questions that are essential for preserving artistic integrity and ensuring that everyone is treated fairly in this new ecosystem we find ourselves in with these new AI tools at our disposal. Increasingly these tools are being used to automate human creativity, not to augment the creative process.

                <h1 class="section-title">The Problem of Data</h1>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Generative AI has a few problems with regards to ethics. Perhaps the biggest question is where does all the data needed to train these models actually come from? The unfortunate answer to that is that it is almost entirely scraped off the internet. Scraping is a process by which an automated process downloads content such as images or music off a webpage. This is problematic in two ways. Firstly, using a work for commercial purposes or financial gain without permission is copyright infringement and theft. Secondly, there are some truly horrific things that get posted to the Internet in every form. That content ends up in AI datasets, and the model gets trained off of that content. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01963.pdf">In a study by Kahembwe, Emmanuel, et al. "Multimodal datasets: misogyny, pornography, and malignant stereotypes"</a>, they looked at what kinds of content, specifically imagery, can be found inside AI training datasets. What they found was, as the title of the paper suggests, pretty horrifying. I think it goes without saying that that type of content should not be in training data, since it teaches the AI to generate more of that kind of content. So there is an argument to be made against scraping data just from the standpoint of the quality of data.</p> 

                <p class="section-text">Not only is scraping content off the Internet bad for data quality, it is also theft and copyright infringement. Meta is currently facing a class action lawsuit for pirating nearly 82 Terabytes of books just for AI training in secret. That is an absolutely unfathomable amount of stolen books, easily within the multi-millions of books. The keyword is “piracy”. None of those books were obtained by legal means, no author was compensated for their work. However it isn’t just authors that this kind of thing happens to, it happens to artists of all kinds. It has gotten so bad that a researcher developed a tool called Nightshade, that alters digital artwork to essentially poison the dataset, so that the AI model interprets the image to be something totally different than what’s depicted.</p>

                <p class="section-text">
                    Another side effect of the lack of ethics surrounding AI is that it can be really easy to use for malicious purposes. Spreading misinformation is a huge problem since it is so easy to create with AI tools. Now with just a few keystrokes and the click of a button, you can generate an entire fake news story about whatever you want. There have been many many examples of politicians using AI imagery to smear their opponents. And while it doesn’t seem bad to those of us that can spot AI fakery, people who aren’t so tech savvy are vulnerable to this kind of manipulation. Not only that, but generative AI is constantly evolving and improving, it’s getting harder and harder to tell what’s AI and what’s not. You can generate very realistic looking images with just a click and a few keystrokes.

                <p class="section-text">
                    Apart from misinformation, there is yet another problem that AI presents us with. When you can generate works of art or music with the click of a button, why even hire an artist? Artists are expensive and it takes time to produce something of quality, but AI only takes a few seconds and at fractions of the cost. Around December of 2024, Coca Cola rolled out an entirely AI generated advertisement that actually aired, and it was received very poorly, sporting about nine thousand likes to about 162,000 dislikes. How many jobs were turned into just a single prompt? How many people didn’t have the opportunity to earn a wage on a commercial project? In addition, Meta has stated many times that they want to replace all their software engineers with generative AI. It’s debatable whether or not that will happen, but the prospect is certainly terrifying for a lot of engineers and artists alike, and it has certainly cost people their jobs. So, essentially yet another way AI can and has been used in a way that is blatantly unethical is by automating jobs that should not be automated. Human creativity should be augmented by AI tools, not replaced completely.
